            <h2>History of Blacksmithing</h2>
            <div id="Mythology">
                <h2>Mythology</h2>
                <p>
                    In Greek Mythology, A supremely skilled artisan whose forge was a volcano, he constructed most of the weapons of the gods, as well as beautiful assistants for his smithy and a metal fishing-net of astonishing intricacy. He was the god of metalworking, fire, and craftsmen. The name of the god is Hephaestus.<br>
                    In Celtic mythology, the role of Smith is held by eponymous (their names do mean 'smith') characters : Goibhniu (Irish myths of the Tuatha Dé Danann cycle) or Gofannon (Welsh myths/ the Mabinogion). Brigid or Brigit, an Irish goddess, is sometimes described as the patroness of blacksmiths.<br>
                    In Hindu mythology, Tvastar also known as Vishvakarma is the blacksmith of the devas. The earliest references of Tvastar can be found in the Rigveda.

            <div id="Before-the-Iron-Age">
                <h2>Before the Iron Age</h2>
                <p>
                    In the early days of blacksmithing, before steel and iron became prevalent in metalworking, blacksmiths relied on simple tools crafted from natural materials such as stone, bone, wood, and bronze.<br>
                    Before bronze was used, copper was used. Unlike copper, bronze is not a natural resource but an alloy of copper and tin. Bronze is superior to just copper, by being harder, being more resistant to corrosion. This allowed stronger weapons to be made. (Bronze Weapons)<br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Iron-Age">
                <h2>Iron Age</h2>
                <p>
                    As the age suggests, iron was used during this time period. <br>
                    Even though there were some iron artifacts before this age, it was not as understood as the current age.<br>
                    One of the civilization to be more knowledgeable of iron was The Hittites of Anatolia. (The following is from Wikipedia)<br>
                    The Hittites of Anatolia first discovered or developed the smelting of iron ores around 1500 BC. They seem to have maintained a near monopoly on the knowledge of iron production for several hundred years, but when their empire collapsed during the Eastern Mediterranean upheavals around 1200 BC, the knowledge seems to have escaped in all directions.<br>
                    The funny thing is, although iron is stronger overall, there are more bronze artifacts perserved in museums as compared to iron artifacts.<br>
                    Bronze is more corrosion-resistant than iron as bronze artifacts were found to be able to last thousands of years whereas iron rust completely in less than 100 years.<br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Medieval-period">
                <h2>Medieval period</h2>
                <p>
                    In the medieval period, blacksmithing was considered part of the set of seven mechanical arts. (a medieval concept of ordered practices or skills)
                    Every town during the medieval period had a blacksmith. It was an essential to have a blacksmith. They are that important to medieval society.
                    There were women that were blacksmiths during this time period. in 1346 Katherine Le Fevre was appointed by Edward III to ‘keep up the king's forge within the Tower and carry on [its] work … receiving the wages pertaining to the office’.
                    Another example is of Alice la Haubergere (Mail-maker) who owned an armour shop and worked as an armourer in Cheapside.
                    One of the most common medieval techniques was forging. Forging is the process of heating metal until it is soft enough to be shaped with a hammer and anvil.
                    Another common technique was welding. Welding is the process of joining two pieces of metal together by heating them until they melt and then hammering them together.
                    There is also a variety of other techniques, such as casting, cutting, and filing. (More on that at the "Process of how they make stuff" tab)
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Industrial-era">
                <h2>Industrial era</h2>
                <p>
                    During the early to mid-nineteenth century, both European armies as well as both the U.S. Federal and Confederate armies employed blacksmiths to shoe horses and repair equipment such as wagons, horse tack, and artillery equipment. These smiths primarily worked at a traveling forge that when combined with a limber, comprised wagons specifically designed and constructed as blacksmith shops on wheels to carry the essential equipment necessary for their work.<br>
                    This would be the era that blacksmiths would not be as needed as before.
                    During the 1790s Henry Maudslay created the first screw-cutting lathe, a watershed event that signaled the start of blacksmiths being replaced by machinists in factories for the hardware needs of the populace.
                    As demand for their products declined, many more blacksmiths augmented their incomes by taking in work shoeing horses. A shoer-of-horses was historically known as a farrier in English. With the introduction of automobiles, the number of blacksmiths continued to decrease, many former blacksmiths becoming the initial generation of automobile Mechanics. The nadir of blacksmithing in the United States was reached during the 1960s, when most of the former blacksmiths had left the trade, and few if any new people were entering the trade. By this time, most of the working blacksmiths were those performing farrier work, so the term blacksmith was effectively co-opted by the farrier trade.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Modern">
                <h2>Modern</h2>
                <p>
                    A renewed interest in blacksmithing occurred as part of the trend in "do-it-yourself" and "self-sufficiency" that occurred during the 1970s. <br>
                    Currently there are many books, organizations and individuals working to help educate the public about blacksmithing, including local groups of smiths who have formed clubs, with some of those smiths demonstrating at historical sites and living history events. <br>
                    Some modern blacksmiths who produce decorative metalwork refer to themselves as artist-blacksmiths. In 1973 the Artists Blacksmiths’ Association of North America was formed with 27 members. By 2013 it had almost 4000 members. <br>
                    Likewise the British Artist Blacksmiths Association was created in 1978, with 30 charter members and had about 600 members in 2013 and publish for members a quarterly magazine.<br>
                    While developed nations saw a decline and re-awakening of interest in blacksmithing, in many developing nations blacksmiths continued making and repairing iron and steel tools and hardware for people in their local area.<br>

                            It consists of a wooden or metal pole with a curved single-edged blade on the end; it is similar to the Chinese guan dao or the European glaive. <br>

                        <p>
                            A Warhammer is a weapon that was used by both foot soldiers and cavalry. It is a very old weapon and gave its name, owing to its constant use, to Judah Maccabee, a 2nd-century BC Jewish rebel, and to Charles Martel, one of the rulers of France.<br>
                            The war hammer was a popular weapon in the late medieval period. It became somewhat of a necessity in combat when armor became so strong that swords and axes were no longer able to pierce and ricocheted upon impact. The war hammer could inflict significant damage on the enemy through their heavy impact without the need to pierce the armor.<br>
                            A war hammer consists of a handle and a head. The length of the handle may vary, the longest being roughly equivalent to that of a halberd (five to six feet or 1.5 to 1.8 meters), and the shortest about the same as that of a mace (two to three feet or 60 to 90 centimeters). Long war hammers were polearms meant for use by foot soldiers, whereas shorter ones were primarily used by those mounted.<br>
                            War hammers, especially when mounted on a pole, could in some cases transmit their impact through helmets and cause concussions. Later war hammers often had a spike on one side of the head, making them more versatile weapons.<br>
                            The back spike could be used for hooking a target's armor, reins, or shield. The blunt side of a war hammer was usually used first to knock down and stun an enemy and, once the opponent were immobilized on the ground, the hammer is rotated around to hit the target with the pointed side, which can punch a hole through the helmet and deliver the coup de grâce. A powerful swing from a war hammer (especially with the spike) can deliver a strike force of several hundred kilograms per square millimeter – this is the same penetrating force as a rifle bullet.<br>

                <div id="Forging" class="subpage">
                    <p>
                        Forging—the process smiths use to shape metal by hammering—differs from machining in that forging does not remove material. Instead, the smith hammers the iron into shape. <br>
                        These operations generally require at least a hammer and anvil, but smiths also use other tools and techniques to accommodate odd-sized or repetitive jobs.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="Drawing" class="subpage">
                    <p>
                        Drawing lengthens the metal by reducing one or both of the other two dimensions. As the depth is reduced, or the width narrowed, the piece is lengthened or "drawn out." <br>
                        As an example of drawing, a smith making a chisel might flatten a square bar of steel, lengthening the metal, reducing its depth but keeping its width consistent. <br>
                        Drawing does not have to be uniform. A taper can result as in making a wedge or a woodworking chisel blade. If tapered in two dimensions, a point results. <br>
                        Drawing can be accomplished with a variety of tools and methods. Two typical methods using only hammer and anvil would be hammering on the anvil horn, and hammering on the anvil face using the cross peen of a hammer.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="Bending" class="subpage">
                    <p>
                        Heating iron to a "forging heat" allows bending as if it were a soft, ductile metal, like copper or silver. <br>
                        Bending can be done with the hammer over the horn or edge of the anvil or by inserting a bending fork into the hardy hole (the square hole in the top of the anvil), placing the work piece between the tines of the fork, and bending the material to the desired angle. <br>
                        Bends can be dressed and tightened, or widened, by hammering them over the appropriately shaped part of the anvil.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="Upsetting" class="subpage">
                    <p>
                        Upsetting is the process of making metal thicker in one dimension through shortening in the other. One form is to heat the end of a rod and then hammer on it as one would drive a nail: the rod gets shorter, and the hot part widens. <br>
                        An alternative to hammering on the hot end is to place the hot end on the anvil and hammer on the cold end.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="Punching" class="subpage">
                    <p>
                        Punching may be done to create a decorative pattern, or to make a hole. For example, in preparation for making a hammerhead, a smith would punch a hole in a heavy bar or rod for the hammer handle. <br>
                        Punching is not limited to depressions and holes. It also includes cutting, slitting, and drifting—all done with a chisel.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="Welding" class="subpage">
                    <p>
                        Welding is the joining of the same or similar kind of metal. <br>
                        The smith first cleans parts to be joined with a wire brush, then puts them in the fire to heat. <br>
                        With a mix of drawing and upsetting the smith shapes the faces so that when finally brought together, the center of the weld connects first and the connection spreads outward under the hammer blows, pushing out the flux (if used) and foreign material. <br>
                        The dressed metal goes back in the fire, is brought near to welding heat, removed from the fire, and brushed. <br>
                        There is some challenge to this because, to see the color of the metal, the smith must remove it from the fire—exposing it to air, which can rapidly oxidize it.<br>
                        A few light hammer taps bring the mating faces into complete contact and squeeze out the flux—and finally, the smith returns the work to the fire. <br>
                        The weld begins with the taps, but often the joint is weak and incomplete, so the smith reheats the joint to welding temperature and works the weld with light blows to "set" the weld and finally to dress it to the shape.<br>

                </div>
                <div id="Finishing" class="subpage">
                    <p>
                        Depending on the intended use of the piece, a blacksmith may finish it in a number of ways:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A simple jig (a tool) that the smith might only use a few times in the shop may get the minimum of finishing—a rap on the anvil to break off scale and a brushing with a wire brush.</li>
                            <li>Files bring a piece to final shape, removing burrs and sharp edges, and smoothing the surface.</li>
                            <li>Heat treatment and case-hardening achieve the desired hardness.</li>
                            <li>The wire brush—as a hand tool or power tool—can further smooth, brighten, and polish surfaces.</li>
                            <li>Grinding stones, abrasive paper, and emery wheels can further shape, smooth, and polish the surface.</li>
                        </ul>
                        A range of treatments and finishes can inhibit oxidation and enhance or change the appearance of the piece. <br>
                        An experienced smith selects the finish based on the metal and on the intended use of the item. <br>
                        Finishes include (among others): paint, varnish, bluing, browning, oil, and wax. <br>
